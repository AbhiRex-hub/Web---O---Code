ED - TECH Company Landing Page
Hello,
In this project, I have chosen ED -Tech as the theme and I have created a landing page of a company called "Curiosity".
Inspiration: Today, the education system only focuses on getting good marks, higher ranks. But, in these things, the real essence of learning is missing. Learning should be done to satisfy the curiosity and not merely for getting marks. Thus, this company tries to nurture the curiosity.
The website uses gradients and minimalistic approach. 
I have used HTML & CSS only. The external libraries used are data flickity for sliding functionality.
Below is a sample screenshot of the landing page:
